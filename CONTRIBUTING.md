# Contribution Guidelines

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process of this project. I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. Thank you for helping out and remember, No contribution is too small.

## Steps to Contribute

Please make sure you follow this guidelines so your code can be merged as quickly as possible

### Issues / Features 

When contributing to this repository, if you notice any bugs or issues or you have an idea/feature you would like to add to this project, please raise an **issue** first.

### Making Changes

When making changes, fixing an issue or adding features to this project, please only add code that is related to the issue or feature you have been assigned to. For example, If your feature is to add a button, your pull request should contain code that adds the button only.

- Don't make two different changes in one pull request. If you see another issue aside from the one you are working on. Raise a different PR for it.
- And remember the smaller the change, the faster for it to be reviewed and merged.
- Give a meaningful name to whatever file or folder you are adding.

### Commits

Write your commit message in the imperative: **"Fix bug"** and not **"Fixed bug"** or **"Fixes bug."** This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

- Keep your commits short but descriptive.
- Do not end a commit message with a period `.`
- None code contributions should contain the keyword `[skip-deploy]` in the commit message to prevent vercel from building the entire app. Example. `git commit -m 'update README.md [skip-deploy]'`
